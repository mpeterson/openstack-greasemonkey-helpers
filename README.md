# openstack-greasemonkey-helpers
Some greasemonkey scripts that might aid in the development of openstack projects

## Current scripts

- **openstack_gerrit_zuul_status.user.js**: Provides the status of the current CI run on the OpenStack Gerrit in real time.
- **FoxReplace.json** is text replacements configuration for https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/foxreplace/ which
would add some extra coloring on build logs, making them easier to read.
We plan to convert this into a greasemonkey helper in the future to allow
use from multiple browsers.
